=> Insertion Minimumm,
=> Minimum Deletion.
=> Delete Maximum,
=> Get Maximum,
=> Get Minimum



Given a linked list of integer rearrange the list such that are even no. appear before all odd & and orders of even / odd is maintained
3,20,10,5,7,4

mainatain the even head and odd head, as a reference
